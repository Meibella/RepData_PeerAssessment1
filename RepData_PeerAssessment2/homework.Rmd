```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, message=FALSE)
```

## Loading the data

```{r}
rawdata <- read.csv("./repdata-data-StormData.csv")
```

Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

```{r}
totalFatalities <- aggregate(rawdata$FATALITIES ~ rawdata$EVTYPE, data=rawdata, FUN="sum")
higestFatality <- totalFatalities[which.max(totalFatalities[,2]),]

```

Answer: Tornado are most harmful in terms of total fatalities: `r higestFatality`

Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

```{r}
#Calculate the sum of actual PROPDMG and CROPDMG across all types and find the maximum
```
